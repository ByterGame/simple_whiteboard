**About MorePlayersUp Branch**\
This branch was planned as a large-scale upgrade, but in the end it turned out to be some kind of hat that can handle more than two clients at a time (the default maximum value of clients is 3, but you can change the condition in the `application.py` script and everything will be limited only by the power of your computer, although it may be something else..)
